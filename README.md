**Hi, I’m @s-0-p-h-i-a**
- Interested in: maths, programming, logic, sensors, automotive systems
- Maths and CS B.Sc. student specialising in microprocessors, logic and embedded systems
- Currently self-learning: C++, Arduino Uno, electronics, automotive sensors

This profile contains:
- Repos for C++ projects I create as part of my (re)learning process. New versions are added as I explore new topics or refine older code
- Beginner Arduino and sensor projects as a first step toward working with embedded systems

---
**FEATURED**
- [Arduino RGB LED + Photoresistor Experiments:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/RGB_LED_PR+BUTTONS/Plotter_and_Hysteresis) exploring data visualisation via Serial Plotter, analog signal processing, PWM and hysteresis

---
**Latest**
- [Flywheel Hall Sensor:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Flywheel_RPM_Hall_Sensor) code + documentation from initial proof of concept work
- [Arduino RGB + Photoresistor + Buttons Project:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/RGB_LED_PR+BUTTONS) Serial Plotter, signal processing and hysteresis experiment folder, including demo GIFs and diagram
- [Arduino Choose LED (Photoresistor + Button) Project:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/Choose_LED_Photoresistor) demo GIFs, wiring diagram, schematic, Tinkercad sim
- [Fitness Tracker v3.0:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Fitness_Tracker) README and dev log
- [Zodiac Calculator v3.0:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Zodiac_Calculator) new refactor introducing functions and improved input validation

---

**Planned:**
- **Wheatstone Bridge Emulation:** breadboard setup with resistors + sensor and Serial Plotter voltage reading

---
