**Hi, I’m @s-0-p-h-i-a**
- Interested in: maths, programming, logic, sensors, microcontrollers, automotive systems
- Maths and CS B.Sc. student specialising in microprocessors and embedded systems
- Currently self-learning: C++, Arduino Uno, electronics, automotive sensors

This profile contains:
- Repos for C++ projects I create as part of my (re)learning process. New versions are added as I explore new topics or refine older code
- Beginner Arduino and sensor projects as a first step toward working with embedded systems

---
**FEATURED**
- [Flywheel Hall Sensor:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Flywheel_RPM_Hall_Sensor) Added detailed power supply debugging + components testing + build & test plan + test script drafts
- [Arduino RGB LED + Photoresistor Experiments:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/RGB_LED_PR+BUTTONS/Plotter_and_Hysteresis) Exploring data visualisation via Serial Plotter, analog signal processing, PWM and hysteresis
- [Fitness Tracker v4.0:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Fitness_Tracker/tree/main/Fitness_Tracker_v4) Structural refactor into modular function declaration files

---
**Latest**
- [Zodiac Calculator v4.0:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Zodiac_Calculator) Refactor breaking main file into main + support files
- [Flywheel Hall Sensor:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Flywheel_RPM_Hall_Sensor) Wrote build & test plan, added multimeter and wire splicing support materials to kit, wrote test script drafts
- [Fitness Tracker v4.0:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Fitness_Tracker/tree/main/Fitness_Tracker_v4) Big refactor breaking long main file into main + header and function definition files
- [Arduino RGB + Photoresistor + Buttons Project:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/RGB_LED_PR+BUTTONS) Serial Plotter, signal processing and hysteresis experiment folder, including demo GIFs and diagram
- [Arduino Choose LED (Photoresistor + Button) Project:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/Choose_LED_Photoresistor) Demo GIFs, wiring diagram, schematic, Tinkercad sim
