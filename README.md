**Hi, I’m @s-0-p-h-i-a**
- Interested in: maths, programming, logic, sensors, automotive systems
- Maths and CS B.Sc. student specialising in microprocessors, logic and embedded systems
- Currently self-learning: C++, Arduino Uno

This profile contains:
- Repos for C++ projects I create as part of my (re)learning process. New versions are added as I explore new topics or refine older code
- Beginner Arduino projects repo as a first step toward embedded systems

---

**Latest**
- [Arduino RGB + photoresistors + buttons project](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/RGB_LED_PR%2BBUTTONS): added first RGB LED project
- [Arduino choose LED (photoresistor + button) project](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/Choose_LED_Photoresistor): added Digital Logic folder with combinational circuit simulation and boolean function analysis
- [Fitness Tracker v3.0](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Fitness_Tracker): added README and dev log
- [Zodiac Calculator v3.0](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Zodiac_Calculator): new refactor introducing functions and improved input validation
