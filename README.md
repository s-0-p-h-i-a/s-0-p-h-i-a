**Hi, I’m @s-0-p-h-i-a**
- Interested in: computer science, maths, logic, sensors, microcontrollers, automotive systems
- Maths and CS B.Sc. student specialising in embedded systems and microprocessors
- Currently self-learning: C/C++, Arduino Uno, electronics, automotive sensors

This profile contains:
- Repos for C/C++ projects I create as part of my (re)learning process. New versions are added as I explore new topics or refine older code
- Beginner Arduino and sensor projects to learn how to work with embedded systems

---
**FEATURED**
- [Flywheel Hall Sensor:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Flywheel_RPM_Hall_Sensor) Flywheel RPM Hall sensor simulation + FSM logic implementation
- [Arduino RGB LED + Photoresistor Experiments:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/RGB_LED_PR+BUTTONS/Plotter_and_Hysteresis) Exploring data visualisation via Serial Plotter, analog signal processing, PWM and hysteresis
- [Fitness Tracker v5:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Fitness_Tracker/tree/main/Fitness_Tracker_v5) First practice in learning C, v5.1 introduces enums

---
**Latest**
- [Fitness Tracker v5.1:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Fitness_Tracker/tree/main/Fitness_Tracker_v5/v5_1) Implement enums and define const variables
- [Flywheel Hall Sensor:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Flywheel_RPM_Hall_Sensor) Main program refactor draft implementing state machine and sequential circuit logic
- [Zodiac Calculator v4.0:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Zodiac_Calculator) Refactor breaking main file into main + support files
- [Arduino RGB + Photoresistor + Buttons Project:](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/RGB_LED_PR+BUTTONS) Serial Plotter, signal processing and hysteresis experiment folder, including demo GIFs and diagram

---
**Planned:**
- **Wheatstone Bridge Emulation:** breadboard setup with resistors + sensor and Serial Plotter voltage reading
- **State Machine Emulation:** using structs to model simple Mealy machine behaviour
