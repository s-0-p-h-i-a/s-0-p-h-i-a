**Hi, I’m @s-0-p-h-i-a**
- Interested in: computer science, maths, logic, sensors, microcontrollers, embedded automotive systems
- Maths and CS B.Sc. student specialising in embedded systems and microprocessors
- Currently self-learning: C/C++, Arduino Uno, electronics, sensors

This profile contains:
- Repos for C/C++ projects I create as part of my learning process. New versions are added as I explore new topics or refine older code
- Arduino and sensor projects to learn how to build embedded systems

---
**FEATURED**

- [ICE Engine Mini Prototype](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/ICE_Engine_Simulations/tree/main/Full_Engine):

  ECU firmware-inspired ICE engine simulation prototype, ongoing project progressively merging engine sub-system modules.
  
**Current Modules:**
- Live RPM Calculation: using servo "flywheel" and Hall sensor
- LED Cylinder Visualisation: coloured breadboard LED matrix representing a single cylinder moving through the combustion cycle
- Joystick Control: toggles previous 2 modules on/off, 2 speed settings
- Data Interface: processes system data and feeds it to plotter module
- Plotter: live telemetry

**Upcoming Modules:**
- Crankshaft
- Cylinder head:
  - Double camshafts
  - Valves
  - Fuel injectors
  - Spark plugs
