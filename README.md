**Hi, I’m @s-0-p-h-i-a**
- Interested in: computer science, maths, logic, sensors, microcontrollers, automotive systems
- Maths and CS B.Sc. student specialising in embedded systems and microprocessors
- Currently self-learning: C/C++, Arduino Uno, electronics, automotive sensors

This profile contains:
- Repos for C/C++ projects I create as part of my (re)learning process. New versions are added as I explore new topics or refine older code
- Beginner Arduino and sensor projects to learn how to work with embedded systems

---
**FEATURED**
- [Flywheel Hall Sensor](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Flywheel_RPM_Hall_Sensor): WIP Flywheel RPM Hall sensor simulation + FSM logic implementation
- [ICE Engine Simulations](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/ICE_Engine_Simulations): WIP Simulating cylinder and crankshaft behaviour in Arduino hardware projects and CLI apps, using C and state machine logic
- [Arduino RGB LED + Photoresistor Experiments](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/RGB_LED_PR+BUTTONS/Plotter_and_Hysteresis): Exploring data visualisation via Serial Plotter, analog signal processing, PWM and hysteresis
- [Fitness Tracker v5](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Fitness_Tracker/tree/main/Fitness_Tracker_v5): First practice in learning C

---
**Planned:**
- **Inline-4 Engine Control Simulation:** progressively merge separately developed cylinder, crankshaft, camshaft modules into a controller for a virtual inline-4 engine
- **Wheatstone Bridge Emulation:** breadboard setup with resistors + sensor and Serial Plotter voltage reading
- **State Machine Emulation:** using structs to model simple Mealy machine behaviour
