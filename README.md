**Hi, I’m @s-0-p-h-i-a**
- Interested in: maths, programming, logic, sensors, automotive systems
- Maths and CS B.Sc. student specialising in microprocessors, logic and embedded systems
- Currently self-learning: C++, Arduino Uno

This profile contains:
- Repos for C++ projects I create as part of my (re)learning process. New versions are added as I explore new topics or refine older code
- Beginner Arduino projects repo as a first step toward embedded systems

---
**FEATURED**
[Arduino RGB LED + Photoresistor Experiments](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/RGB_LED_Photoresistor/Plotter_and_Hysteresis): exploring data visualisation via Serial Plotter, analog signal processing, PWM and hysteresis

---
**Latest**
- [Arduino RGB + Photoresistor + Buttons Project](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/RGB_LED_Photoresistor): added Serial Plotter, signal processing and hysteresis experiment folder
- [Arduino Choose LED (Photoresistor + Button) Project](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice/tree/main/Choose_LED_Photoresistor): added demo GIFs, wiring diagram, schematic, Tinkercad sim
- [Fitness Tracker v3.0](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Fitness_Tracker): added README and dev log
- [Zodiac Calculator v3.0](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Zodiac_Calculator): new refactor introducing functions and improved input validation

---

**Currently Working On**
- **MAP sensor Wheatstone bridge emulation:** resistors + photoresistor/phototransistor with Serial Plotter voltage reading
- **Flywheel RPM reading emulation with Hall sensor and servo motor:** proof of concept report incl. code + documentation + diagrams + demo

---

**Repos**
- [Fitness Tracker](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Fitness_Tracker): a console app that tracks workouts over 4 weeks and gives feedback based on frequency 
- [Zodiac Calculator](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Zodiac_Calculator): a console app that calculates zodiac signs from user birthdates
- [Arduino Practice Projects](https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Arduino_Practice): small beginner projects to get started with microcontrollers
